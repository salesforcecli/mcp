## Overview of the Salesforce DX MCP Server (Beta)

The Salesforce DX MCP Server is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation designed to facilitate seamless interaction between large language models (LLMs) and Salesforce orgs. This MCP server provides a robust set of tools and capabilities that enable LLMs to read, manage, and operate Salesforce resources securely.

> [!NOTE]
> _Salesforce DX MCP Server is a pilot or beta service that is subject to the Beta Services Terms at [Agreements - Salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/) or a written Unified Pilot Agreement if executed by Customer, and applicable terms in the [Product Terms Directory](https://ptd.salesforce.com/). Use of this pilot or beta service is at the Customer's sole discretion._

## Configure the DX MCP Server

Configure the Salesforce DX MCP Server for your MCP client by updating its associated MCP JSON file; each client is slightly different, so check your MCP client documentation for details. See [MCP Client Configurations](./README.md#mcp-client-configurations) for more examples. 

Here's an example for VS Code with Copilot in which you create and update a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project:

```
{
     "servers": {
       "Salesforce DX": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@salesforce/mcp", 
                 "--orgs", "DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG", 
                 "--toolsets", "orgs,metadata,data,users",
                 "--tools", "run_apex_test",
                 "--allow-non-ga-tools"]
       }
     }
}
```

The `args` format shown in the preceding example is the same for all MCP clients; it's how you customize the DX MCP Server for your particular environment. Notes:

- The `"-y", "@salesforce/mcp"` part tells `npx` to automatically install the `@salesforce/mcp` package instead of asking permission. Don't change this. 
- See the *Reference* sections below for the possible flags you can pass the `args` option, and possible values you can pass to the `--orgs`, `--toolsets`, and `--tools` flags. 
- When writing the `args` option, surround both the flag names and their values in double quotes, and separate all flags and values with commas. Some flags are Boolean and don't take a value.
- The preceding example shows three flags that take a string value (`--orgs`, `--toolsets`, and `--tools`) and one Boolean flag (`--allow-non-ga-tools`).  This configuration starts a DX MCP Server that enables all the MCP tools in the `orgs`, `metadata`, `data`, and `users` toolsets and a specific tool called `run_apex_tests`.  It also enables tools in these configured toolsets that aren't yet generally available.

## MCP Client Configurations

Here are examples of configuring the Salesforce DX MCP Server in various MCP clients. 

### Claude Code

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Salesforce DX": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@salesforce/mcp@latest",

               "--tools", "run_apex_test",
               "--allow-non-ga-tools" ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cline

               "--tools", "run_apex_test",
               "--allow-non-ga-tools" ]
    }
  }
}
```

<summary>Reference: Available Flags for the `args` Option</summary>

## Available Flags for the "args" Option

These are the flags that you can pass to the `args` option. 

| Flag Name | Description | Required? |Notes |
| -----------------| -------| ------- | ----- |
| `--orgs` | One or more orgs that you've locally authorized. | Yes | You must specify at least one org. <br/> <br/>See [Configure Orgs](./README.md#configure-orgs) for the values you can pass to this flag. |
| `--toolsets` | Sets of tools, based on functionality, that you want to enable. | No | Set to "all" to enable every tool in every toolset. <br/> <br/>See [Configure Toolsets](./README.md#configure-toolsets) for the values you can pass to this flag.|
| `--tools` | Individual tool names that you want to enable. | No | You can use this flag in combination with the `--toolsets` flag. For example, you can enable all tools in one toolset, and just one tool in a different toolset. |
| `--no-telemetry` | Boolean flag to disable telemetry, the automatic collection of data for monitoring and analysis. | No | Telemetry is enabled by default, so specify this flag to disable it.  |
| `--debug` | Boolean flag that requests that the DX MCP Server print debug logs. | No | Debug mode is disabled by default. <br/> <br/>**NOTE:** Not all MCP clients expose MCP logs, so this flag might not work for all IDEs. |
| `--allow-non-ga-tools` | Boolean flag to allow the DX MCP Server to use both the generally available (GA) and NON-GA tools that are in the toolsets or tools you specify. | No | By default, the DX MCP server uses only the tools marked GA. |
| `--dynamic-tools` | (experimental) Boolean flag that enables dynamic tool discovery and loading. When specified, the DX MCP server starts with a minimal set of core tools and loads new tools as needed. | No| This flag is useful for reducing the initial context size and improving LLM performance. Dynamic tool discovery is disabled by default.<br/> <br/>**NOTE:** This feature works in VSCode and Cline but may not work in other environments.|

<summary>Reference: Configure Orgs</summary>

## Configure Orgs

The Salesforce MCP tools require an org, and so you must include the required `--orgs` flag to specify at least one authorized org when you configure the MCP server. Separate multiple values with commas.

You must explicitly [authorize the orgs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_web_flow.htm) on your computer before the MCP server can access them. Use the `org login web` Salesforce CLI command or the VS Code **SFDX: Authorize an Org** command from the command palette.

These are the available values for the `--orgs` flag:

| --orgs Value | Description |
| -------- | ---------- |
| `DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG` | Allow access to your default org. If you've set a local default org in your DX project, the MCP server uses it. If not, the server uses a globally-set default org.|
| `DEFAULT_TARGET_DEV_HUB` | Allow access to your default Dev Hub org. If you've set a local default Dev Hub org in your DX project, the MCP server uses it. If not, the server uses a globally-set default Dev Hub org.|
| `ALLOW_ALL_ORGS` | Allow access to all authorized orgs. Use this value with caution.|
| `<username or alias>` | Allow access to a specific org by specifying its username or alias.|

</details>

<details>
<summary>Reference: Configure Toolsets and Tools</summary>

## Configure Toolsets

The Salesforce DX MCP Server supports **toolsets** - a way to selectively enable different groups of MCP tools based on your needs. This allows you to run the MCP server with only the tools you require, which in turn reduces the context.

Use the `--toolsets` flag to specify the toolsets when you configure the Salesforce DX MCP Server. Separate multiple toolsets with commas. 

These are the available toolsets.

| Toolset| Description|
| ----- | ----- |
| `all` | Enables all available tools from all toolsets. Use caution, this will load over 60 tools. |
| `orgs` | [Tools to manage your authorized orgs.](README.md#orgs-toolset)|
| `data` | [Tools to manage the data in your org, such as listing all accounts.](README.md#data-toolset)|
| `users` | [Tools to manage org users, such as assigning a permission set.](README.md#users-toolset)|
| `metadata` | [Tools to deploy and retrieve metadata to and from your org and your DX project.](README.md#metadata-toolset)|
| `testing` | [Tools to test your code and features](README.md#testing-toolset)|
| `other` | [Other useful tools, such as tools for static analysis of your code using Salesforce Code Analyzer.](README.md#other-toolset)|
| `mobile` | [Tools for mobile development and capabilities.](README.md#mobile-toolset)|
| `mobile-core` | [A subset of mobile tools focused on essential mobile capabilities.](README.md#mobile-core-toolset)|
| `aura-experts` | [Tools which provides Aura component analysis, blueprinting, and migration expertise.](README.md#aura-experts-toolset)|
| `lwc-experts`  | [Tools to assist with LWC development, testing, optimization, and best practices.](README.md#lwc-experts-toolset)|

## Configure Tools

The Salesforce DX MCP Server also supports registering individual **tools**. This can be used in combination with **toolsets** to further fine-tune registered tools.

Use the `--tools` flag to enable specific tools when you configure the Salesforce DX MCP Server. Separate multiple tools with commas. The `--tools` flag is optional.

The following sections list all the tools that are included in a specific toolset. The tools marked NON-GA are not yet generally available, specify the `--allow-non-ga-tools` flag to use them. 

### Core Toolset (always enabled)
