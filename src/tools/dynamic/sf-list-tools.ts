AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
DO NOT USE THIS TOOL if you already know what tool you need - try to call the tool directly first.
ONLY use this tool if:
1. You tried to call a tool and got an error that it doesn't exist or isn't enabled
2. You genuinely don't know what tools are available for a specific task
3. You need to discover new tools for an unfamiliar use case

When calling this tool, provide a description of what you're trying to accomplish in the query parameter.
Examples: "deploy a file to Salesforce org", "create a scratch org", "retrieve metadata from org"

If you find a tool you want to enable, call sf-enable-tool with the tool name.
Once you have enabled the tool, you MUST invoke that tool to accomplish the user's original request - DO NOT USE A DIFFERENT TOOL OR THE COMMAND LINE.
Once a tool has been enabled, you do not need to call sf-list-tools again - instead, invoke the desired tool directly.`,
